# Mixed-varible-password-generator

## Description

This is a password generator that can be used with different character sets and number of characters. It does not keep a log of the passwords. It is also intended to cycle if invalid responses are given.

## Contributing

I never did figure out how to ensure each selected character set was guaranteed to be used, so that is a known issue. I used the MIT as this is a common project and people are allowed to use it. Pull requests and advice are welcome. For major changes please create an issue first about the changes to be made.
